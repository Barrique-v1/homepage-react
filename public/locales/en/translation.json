      "Before I decided to study, I spent eight years as a mountain infantry soldier in the German Armed Forces. During this time, I not only overcame physical and mental challenges but also developed important skills like discipline, teamwork, and leadership. At the same time, I completed my high school diploma through a distance learning program with the Studiengemeinschaft Darmstadt (SGD). This extra challenge greatly improved my time management and taught me the importance of taking initiative and perseverance.",
      "Starting my studies at the University of Applied Sciences was a conscious decision to move in a new direction. I recently finished my third semester successfully and will begin my fourth semester in October. My interest in software development has grown even more through my studies, and I have built a solid foundation in this field. I especially value the combination of business knowledge and technical skills in my program, which allows me to develop practical and comprehensive solutions.",
      "For the upcoming fourth semester, I am looking for a mandatory internship to apply the knowledge I’ve gained from my studies in a real-world setting and to further improve my skills."
